Scrapping Linked In Pages for a particular company's employees

In this interesting project I have utilized selenium and beautifulsoup libraries to access chrome, logging in to linkedIn using credential file, and scrap employees of a specific company result in generating an excel file and an Image folders with images of those selected profiles.
To run this project a login_credential.txt file should also be present into the folder that should has linkenIn user name and password typed in seperate lines.
